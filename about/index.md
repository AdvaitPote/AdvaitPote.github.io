- My name is Advait Pote and I am an avid open source enthusiast currently residing in Pune, India. 

- I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering. 

- As someone who thrives in dynamic and evolving fields, I am continually expanding my knowledge in blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the future of cryptocurrencies. 

- My hobbies include playing the Guitar, watching Sports and learning new languages. I have been playing the Guitar for more than two years and I hope I can keep getting better and uplift my skills.
