It has been a long time since I added a post here. This blog that I made here to document my progress through my Google Summer of Code Project with SymPy in 2022, is an asset that now belongs to me and I plan on using it to document any progress I make in the Open Source Realm. 

A lot can and indeed has happened in a span of over two years. I recently graduated from IIT Bombay and have secured a full time job. During these two years, I have been active with SymPy and was a GSoC mentor in 2023 and 2024 actively helping my mentees through their projects. I have played my part in developing the Continuum Mechanics module in these years and I plan on being in touch with this Organisation which has taught me so much for as long as I can. 

In 2022, through my mentor Prakhar Saxena, I learnt about Summer of Bitcoin. I had heard about Bitcoin here and there but never delved deep into it. I learnt that it is a programme similar to GSoC which is to encourage more and more contributors into Bitcoin. 

I made my attempt to get selected in this prestigious programme this year. I will be adding a post summarizing this part in the future.
