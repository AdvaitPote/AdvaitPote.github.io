The results of Google Summer of Code 2022 have been announced and I am extremely elated to have my proposal selected amongst many high quality proposals. I am really excited to be given this opportunity and cannot wait to get started.

The organization that I had applied for is [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a Python library which is used by programmers worldwide to solve problems in Symbolic Mathematics and Physics.

Here is my project in brief - 

The current Continuum Mechanics module is very useful and has been developed to a good extent. However, there are many more concepts that are prevalent in the field of Solid Mechanics and have not been implemented in SymPy. This project aims to implement some new classes that would bring these utilities into the module. This way a wider range of engineering problems can be solved using SymPy. The two features that are planned to be implemented are solving Torsional problems due to the presence of torque along the direction of the shaft and calculating internal forces & reactions for a given Truss under external forces and moments. This project also plans to add some functions to the geometry module to add some flexibility to the way one can form composite shapes so that it is easier to define complex cross-sectional geometries for the beam module. Implementing the above-mentioned features will expand SymPy to a great extent and help users solve a wider range of problems with ease and precision.

This is my first post here and I will be adding more posts on this blog as I advance further on my journey!
