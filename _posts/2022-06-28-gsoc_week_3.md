The list of problems that were listed in the previous blog post have been sorted and the respective changes have been pushed. 
- The properties `reaction_forces` and `internal_forces` were added for each support and each member respectively. 
- The method `change_label` was added so that the user can change the label of a node or a member without having to delete it.
- Added a different image for the truss example as the images were added from Russell C. Hibbeler - Mechanics of Materials-Pearson Education (Prentice Hall) and hence could be copyrighted. Out of the two images added, the first image containing examples of multiple trusses was removed and the second image was replaced by the one below.

This truss was generated using [this site](https://skyciv.com/free-truss-calculator/). 

Along with these above, a few minor changes were also made. 

As per the timeline given in my [GSoC Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VyWct2qpX7f7snHPCGNlhKAPti7e5cwxj68RytzR5cc/edit#), I was supposed to get started with the work of the `solve` method to solve for all the reaction forces and the internal forces of the Truss. With my current PR still open, I have started work on the `solve` method separately. As I intend to open a different PR for this method, I will be waiting for my currently open PR [#23629](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23629) to be merged. After that I will open a different PR to push changes related to the `solve` method. 

On the open PR, a few more changes are to be made:
- To have different `change_label` functions for nodes and members to deal with nodes and members having the same labels. 
- When a support is added at a node, a load should be added `'R_'+str(location)+'_x/y'` at the respective node instead of adding a zero force to `_reaction_loads`. The forces should be added to the dictionary only after calling the `solve` method and should be empty otherwise. 
- Follow the same naming scheme as the `Beam` module and hence some methods like `add_support` and `reaction_forces` should be changed to `apply_support` and `reaction_loads`.

Hence, I will be making changes and try to get my first PR get merged as soon as possible and at the same time work on the `solve` method separately.
