I just got done with the `solve` method for the Truss class. As my current PR [#23629](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23629) which is responsible for initializing the Truss class and I intend on making the changes with respect to the `solve` method in  a different PR, I have, as recommended by my mentor Prakhar, made another folder and cloned the SymPy codebase there as well. So basically, I have two folders to work with: one where I will make changes and test out anything and another one for just pushing the changes that I make in the previous folder by just copy-pasting them. This was, I don't have to wait for my previous PR to get merged to start work on a new functionality. 

Due to this, I was able to start and complete the code for the `solve` method. I am yet to add tests and documentation for the same and it shouldn't take much time. 

A basic summary of how the `solve` method is gonna function:

A given truss can be solved if the given condition is met:

$$2n = m + r$$

where $$n$$ is the number of nodes, $$m$$ is the number of members and $$r$$ is the number of reaction loads (if a support is pinned then there are two reaction loads on that support and one reaction load if the support is a roller). 

Take the example of the truss that we have been using,

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/truss_example.png">

Here, we can basically go over each node and write Equilibrium equations in $$x$$ and $$y$$. Hence, we get 8 equations. We have 5 members and 1 pinned support and 1 roller support. Hence, 5 internal forces and 3 reaction loads end up giving us 8 variables. 

To solve this system of 8 equations and 8 variables, the system must be reduced to a matrix equation of the form,

$$C \cdot F = L$$

Where $$C$$ is the Coefficient matrix, $$F$$ is the Forces matrix and $$L$$ is the Load Matrix.

Hence, the result that we are after is, 

$$F = C^{-1} \cdot L$$

The method is all about finding both of these matrices i.e. $$C$$ and $$L$$ and eventually calculating the result of the Matrix Multiplication.
