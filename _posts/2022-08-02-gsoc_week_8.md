Just today, my Pull Request [#23755](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23755) concerned with making changes and adding the `solve` method in the `Truss` class has been merged! This means I am officially done with one major part of my project. The entire `Truss` class implementation that I had planned out as per my proposal has been carried out in SymPy and this is huge for me! 

About the work going on currently, as I had mentioned I would be implementing torsion in the current `Beam3D` class itself, what I did was make another property in the class by `angular_deflection` which was basically a function depicting the angular deflection experienced in a Beam as a particular x from the origin (where the beam is mounted with a wall support). Note that the coordinate system here is defined such that the y and z axes are planar with respect to the beam cross-section and the x axis is parallel to the beam axis. 

This was the property depicting what we want to achieve. The function responsible for actually solving for this property is the `solve_for_torsion` method which has been added as well. How it calculates the results is that it iterates through all moments at different positions starting from the origin. It then uses `Piecewise` functions for each and then adds all such `Piecewise` functions for each moment and eventually makes a Torque Diagram as shown below,

where $$T_A$$ is applied at $$z=a$$ and $$T_B$$ at $$z=a+b$$.   

Thus, the angular deflection at an x is easily calculated as, 

$$\theta(x) = \int_{0}^{x}\frac{T}{G \ J} \text{d}x$$

Currently, this solves only for circular cross-sections and constant moments. 

A pull request, [#23868](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23868), with both the above changes added has been created.
