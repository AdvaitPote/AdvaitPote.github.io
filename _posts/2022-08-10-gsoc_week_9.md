The PR with respect to solving for torsion in a beam was opened by me last week itself. As I had mentioned, it currently solves for circular cross-sections only. Now, in my proposal, I had mentioned that working with non-circular cross-sections requires an extensive mathematical analysis that involves the Prandtl Stress Function. Instead of that, I thought of just using the already derived results for various common shapes in this. 

One can refer to [this](http://www.kmp.tul.cz/system/files/hearn_krouc_nekruh_tenkost_profilu.pdf) for additional information for the same. 

If I intend on going ahead with adding more shapes to the method, the problem is that there is no option to include the shape of the cross-section when initializing a beam. All there is is the Area of the Cross-section for the beam. Modifying the function including the required shape as a parameter is an option. This certainly requires some thinking. 

Now about the future work, I was going through my proposal and now for the final stage of the project, I have mentioned that I will be working on the geometry module. This includes adding a few functions like:
- Calculating the first moment of area for the `Ellipse` class.
- Making composite shapes using Boolean operations on basic shapes in the geometry module. 

However, after giving this some thought, I thought if this goes together with my project. As I have mentioned before, my project is specifically on the Continuum Mechanics submodule and then all of a sudden starting work on the geometry submodule seems a bit out-of-place. A suggestion that I had gotten from Prakhar at the very start was that I can add another function to draw a given Truss after adding all the other methods. A similar function is in the `Beam` class. I would like to work on implementing a similar function for `Truss`. 

As this means I would be going in a direction a bit different from my proposal, I had to discuss this with my mentor. I talked to Prakhar regarding this and he agreed. So now adding this new `draw` method is on my agenda. As a similar method is already in the `Beam` class, I will be referring to that as well for the same.
