The first week of the coding period just ended recently. During this week, I got started with the implementation of the Truss class. With the PR [#23629](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23629), all the initialising methods including 'add_method' and 'add_member'. With this, one can:
- Add a node to the Truss with its label and position.
- Add a member to the Truss with its label and the nodes it is connected to ('Start' and 'End').
- Apply a load of a given Magnitude and direction to a node.
- Apply a 'Pinnned' or a 'Roller' support to a node
- Remove a node from the Truss.
- Remove a member from the Truss.
- Remove a support from a node. 

However, there were problems and some shortcomings that come with it as well that weren't taken into account. 

- Removing a node from a Truss does not remove all the members attached to the node. All members attached to the node should be removed first and only then the node should be removed. 
- There is no direct method to change the label of a node/member. 
- One is able to add a member with the same start and end nodes to the Truss. Moreover, no error is being thrown if another member with the start and end nodes but reversed is added i.e. Two members with the same end points can exist which shouldn't be possible. 

Keeping the above points in mind, more changes were made in the class. The changes have been pushed in the initial part of Week 2.
