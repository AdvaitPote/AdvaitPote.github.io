June 12th, 2022 marked the last day of the Community Bondong Period which started on May 20th. This 24 day period has been really helpful for me as it helped me get in touch with my mentors and also revise & strengthen my concepts of Structural Mechanics that are needed in this project. My mentors for this project are [Prakhar Saxena](https://github.com/Psycho-Pirate) and [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807). I got in touch with Prakhar and also had a few discussions with him as to how should I go about with my project. 

Following this, I have started work on the first Phase of my project. I'll first start with Implementation of the Truss class. The API that I have thought of for the same is as follows.

I'll be starting with the simple Truss initializing methods i.e. 'add_method' and 'add_member'. After that, the solving methods would be taken into work.
