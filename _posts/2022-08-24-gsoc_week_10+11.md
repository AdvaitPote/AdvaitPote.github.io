I talked to Prakhar last weekend and he told me to create a SymPy Wiki page listing down my proposed changes for Phase III of my project: basically how I will be approaching the `draw_truss` method. The link for the same can be found [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2022-Phase-III-plan). I mailed the same to Aaron as well. I got a response yesterday where he approved the changes. 

The `Beam` class uses different methods for each component when drawing a beam like `_draw_supports` and `_draw_load` which are called. From these methods, the locations of all support annotations, markers, support markers, support rectangles, etc, are obtained. Using these parameters, a plot is returned giving the state of the beam where each load and each support are visible. Below is what the plot for a sample beam looks like.

I plan to do something similar to this with separate functions like `_draw_nodes`, `_draw_members`, `_draw_loads`, and `_draw_supports`. Hence, a total of 5 methods, including the main function, would be added. 

About my previous work, my PR [#23868](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23868) concerned with adding torsion to the beam module has been merged as well! It took a little patience as some optional tests were failing. After I resynced my fork, the optional dependencies test started failing. I tried to make all tests pass but it turns out the tests were not failing because of my code but it was in a different file someplace else. Hence, I didn't have to worry about that. 

With this, I am officially done with two phases of my project. Having to work on the beam module itself instead of creating a new class saved a lot of my time.
